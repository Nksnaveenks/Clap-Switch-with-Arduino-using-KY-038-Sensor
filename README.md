The sound sensor allows to detect when the sound has exceeded a set point . The sound or the
sensitivity is detected via a microphone which is already inbuilt in the sensor . The sensitivity level
can be adjusted via a potentiometer .
Relay is used in this circuit to control the current .It controls the high current using a low current
signal .
When the sensitivity exceeds the set point ,the bulb connected will turn on ,the output is sent low .
Once again if the sound exceeds ,the bulb is turned off and the output is sent high.
